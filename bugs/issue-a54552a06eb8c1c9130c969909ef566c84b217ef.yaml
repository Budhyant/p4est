title: Optimize ghost layer
desc: |-
  A few things can be changed in the ghost layer.
  1. API: return a structure that contains offsets for trees and procs.
  2. Test if changing two-round comm to one-round mpi_probe makes it faster.
  3. Test if waitsome or waitany instead of waitall makes it faster.
  4. Limit binary searches to an array view that only contains one tree.
