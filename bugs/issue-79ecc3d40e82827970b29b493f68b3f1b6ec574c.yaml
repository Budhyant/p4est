title: read-safe file write routines
desc: Should the files created by the _save routines be readable by all processes immediately?  With parallel I/O, we need to be sure that the writing has complete before any reading begins, maybe with an MPI_Barrier at the end of _save routines?

    We could document that MPI_File_Close is called.
    The user is then referred to the MPI standard and can take their own actions.
    I think a barrier would not be transparent and rarely needed.
    Propose to keep as is with added documentation.
