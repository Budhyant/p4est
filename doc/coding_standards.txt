This file contains coding guidelines for the p4est library.

* Indentation
  All .c and .h files must be indented with the p4estindent script in
  the main directory. It calls GNU indent with some extra options.

* Comments
  Use doxygen style for comments whenever possible. Comments should
  not exceed the 79th column.

* Integer types
  For processor-local indexing use the p4est_locidx_t data type.
  For globally unique indexing of potentially large numbers use the
  p4est_gloidx_t data type. The int_8 data type may be used only to
  save storage space. Generic integers, booleans and flags should be
  of int type whenever possible. Function arguments should be of int
  type whenever possible.
