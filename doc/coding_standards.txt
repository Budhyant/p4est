This file contains coding guidelines for the p4est library.

* Indentation
  All .c and .h files must be indented with the p4estindent script in
  the main directory. It calls GNU indent with some extra options.

* Comments
  Use doxygen style for comments whenever possible. Comments should
  not exceed the 79th column.

* Integer types
  For processor-local indexing use the p4est_locidx_t data type.
  For globally unique indexing of potentially large numbers use the
  p4est_gloidx_t data type. The int_8 data type may be used only to
  save storage space. Generic integers, booleans and flags should be
  of int type whenever possible. Storage sizes should be size_t.
  Function arguments should be of int type whenever possible.
  For printf and friends use the following conversions.
  %lld (long long) int64_t qcoord_t locidx_t gloidx_t ssize_t
  %llu (unsigned long long) uint64_t size_t

* Variable names
  Loop variables of type int can be named as usual: i, j, etc.
  Loop variables of type size_t should be named is, js, etc.
  Loop variables of type locidx_t should be named il, jl, etc.
  Loop variables of type gloidx_t should be named ig, jg, etc.
