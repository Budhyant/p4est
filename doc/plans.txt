## List of proposed p4est and libsc API changes

### Backards compatible

1.  Increase maximum level in 3D to 30.
2.  Extend the fix for neighborhood_owned to take a btype.
3.  Merge all mesh_edge changes to complete the file.

### Not backwards compatible

Fairly certain:

1.  Merge the removal of comm attributes in sc_init.
2.  Make p4est_refine/coarsen_ext call the replace callback
    always, that is, even if the refine/coarsen callbacks return 0.
3.  Rename the p4est_search functions as in branch p4est_search.
7.  Retire to the attic:
    -   p4est_wrap
    -   pdest
    -   sc_ranges

Undecided:

9.  Remove autoconf logic for Fortran and C++ as well as the
    blas, lapack, and dmatrix code in libsc.
